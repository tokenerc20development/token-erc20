What is Money

Money is an experimental digital currency that allows instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.

Money uses ethereum technology, ERC20 standard token, to operate without a central authority: the management of transactions and the issuance of money are carried out collectively by the ethereum network.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs contract-based applications without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. The Ethereum blockchain focuses on executing the code of any decentralized application.
