What is Money?
Money is an experimental digital currency that allows instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.

Money uses ethereum technology, ERC20 standard token, to operate without a central authority: the management of transactions and the issuance of money are carried out collectively by the ethereum network.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs contract-based applications without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. The Ethereum blockchain focuses on executing the code of any decentralized application.

Development process

Test
Testing and code review is the development bottleneck; we receive more pull requests than we can review and test at short notice. Be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests and remember this is a security critical project where any mistake could cost people a lot of money.
